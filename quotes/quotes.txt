Why do you go away? So that you can come back. So that you can see the place
you came from with new eyes and extra colors. And the people there see you
differently, too. Coming back to where you started is not the same as never
leaving.
~~Terry Pratchett~~

You get a strange feeling when you're about to leave a place...like you'll not
only miss the people you love but you'll miss the person you are now at this
time and this place, because you'll never be this way ever again.
~~Azar Nafisi~~
